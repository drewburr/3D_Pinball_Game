# II. The Guide

Guide Purpose

This guide was created to address certain short-comings, errors and inaccuracies observed in the game Help and other 3D Space Cadet Pinball Guides found online. It is intended to be the most complete and the most accurate guide for 3D Space Cadet Pinball available. If you can't find what you're looking for here it probably doesn't exist.

# III. Concepts

The following sections present basic pinball ideas as they relate to 3D Space
Cadet Pinball. They are intended to aid younger players who may have never
before heard of or seen pinball previously. For more information the Wikipedia
reference to pinball is very informative.

## Pinball Basics

Pinball is a type of coin-operated arcade game where a player attempts to score points by manipulating one or more metal balls on a playfield or table inside a glass covered case called a pinball machine. The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. The Secondary objective is to maximize the time spent playing. Some games, including 3D Space Cadet Pinball, have rudimentary storylines to play through offering the player additional objectives and sense of accomplishment. The player begins with a limited number of balls (typically 3) to accomplish these goals.

Pinball on the computer is based on the physical pinball machine. Pinball machines were introduced in the early 1930s and became a dominant form of entertainment for youth after World War II through the late 1970s. They were eventually overtaken by electronic video games as the game of choice in arcades.

All modern pinball machines consist of a table, plunger, flippers and various other table elements used to score points. The table itself is where the rest of the elements reside. It is sloped slightly from back to front allowing the ball to move by gravity toward the player and the bottom of the table. The ball is initially propelled onto the table via the plunger.

The plunger is a spring-loaded rod with a small handle which is pulled back and let go to allow the ball to be struck and sent onto the table. The player can control the amount of force used for launching by pulling the plunger varying distances, thus changing the compression of the spring. This is often used for a "skill shot", in which a player attempts to launch a ball so that it exactly hits a specified target. Once the ball is in motion on the table the plunger is not used again until the ball drains (see below) and another ball must be brought onto the table.

Once on the table the ball interacts with the table elements primarily by striking them. For each element struck points are added to the score. Pinball scoring can be peculiar and varies greatly from machine to machine. For more particulars on how points are scored for 3D Space Cadet Pinball refer to the Table and Bonus’, Jackpots & Awards sections.

The player’s primary means of controlling the ball once it’s been put into play on the table is via the flippers. Traditionally there are 2 flippers (left & right) located at the bottom of the table. The player activates the flippers in order to send the ball back up the table into the scoring elements and away from the Drain Area.

For more information on table elements refer to the 'Table' section.

## Catching

Catching is a term used to describe the act of allowing the ball to come to rest on one of the flippers. It is a higher level technique used to gain added control over the ball and allow the player to more accurately send the ball up the table at a desired target.

Typically the player catches the ball by holding the flipper in the activated position a having the ball fall on to it. This allows the ball to bounce between the flipper and the return lane eventually coming to rest at the base of the flipper. The player then releases the flipper, allows the ball to roll down the flipper to the desired distance then activates the flipper again.

The ball can also be caught as it drops to the flipper through the return lane.

## Drain

The ball drains when it falls below the flippers and off the bottom of the table. The ball can drain by either dropping between the flippers or passing one of the Out-Lanes. 3D Space Cadet Pinball has Out-Lane Kickers which can save the ball from being drained and send it back up the table.

For more information on the Out-Lane Kickers refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Table Reset

Table reset occurs after the ball drains. It returns all the targets and lights to their default settings.

In 3D Space Cadet Pinball the lights indicating the player’s progress through the story (Rank & Progress Lights) are not reset with the rest of the table.

## Extra Balls

Typically the player begins with 3 balls available and after these balls drain the current game is over. Extra balls, sometimes known as Free Balls, are balls which allow the player to continue play without advancing the ball counter. Extra Balls can typically be collected in great numbers.

If a ball drains and an extra ball has been awarded then the table resets (see above) and a new ball is placed at the plunger. This new ball, however, does not count towards the 3 balls with which the player begins. Once the last awarded extra ball drains the ball counter advances as normal.

Extra Balls can be equated to an extra life in most video games.

For more information on Extra Balls refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Replay Balls

Replay balls are similar to extra balls with one major difference: if the current ball drains and a replay ball has previously been awarded (is available) then the table DOES NOT reset. The new ball placed in the plunger is, for all intent and purposes, the same ball which just drained and the player is allowed to continue the game as if the ball never drained in the first place.

Just as with Extra Balls the ball counter does not advance after the ball drains if a replay is available, however, only one replay ball may typically be collected at any one time.

Replay Balls can be equated to temporary invincibility in most video games.

For more information on Replay Balls refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Nudge/Tilt

Nudging is the secondary way in which the player controls the ball. On physical pinball machines, if the player wished to affect the balls movement when it was not within range of the flippers they would physically jostle the machine. This would affect the angel of the table and cause the ball to roll in a different direction. Nudging the table could be considered a form of cheating and is, therefore, limited by the tilt function.

If the table were nudged or tilted too far or for too long then the table will realize that the player is trying to gain an unfair advantage. This results in the table entering "tilt" mode. All player inputs and all table functions are ceased causing the current ball to drain. The table then resets (see above) and play continues as normal.

For more information refer to "TILT!" in the 'Informational' part of the 'Messages' section.

## End of Game

The game ends when all of the balls the player began with (typically 3) have drained.

The ball counter on the score board indicates the current ball count. This count does not include extra balls or replay balls.

## High Scores

If the game ends and the player has achieved a high enough score then that score and the players name can be added to the High Score Table. This is a list of all the high scores which have been achieved on a particular machine. It allows players to brag to their friends and display their skill to others who play on the same machine.

For more information refer to "High Scores" Dialog Box in the 'Program Controls & Menus' section.

## Final Mission Note

Some strategy guides/walkthroughs indicate that if you light all 18 Progress Light with a Rank of Fleet Admiral that the game will freeze and you will not be able to post your high score. THIS IS NOT TRUE on my version so you may want to test it using the Cheat Codes before you're in a position where you have to choose to complete the Fleet Admiral rank and lock up the game.


# X. Secondary Objectives

The following objectives are not strictly necessary in order to complete missions or increase in rank, however, they are very useful and many players will like to know the ways in which to achieve them. Most of this information is dispersed elsewhere throughout this guide but has been consolidated here for easier reference. Additional information on some of these topics can be found in the 'Bonus', Jackpots and Awards' section.

## Center Post

Overview
- The Center Post is a small peg which rises from the table between the tips of the flippers.
- When activated it greatly reduces the chances the ball will drain between the flippers.
- The Center Post is activated by entering the Hyperspace Kicker 3 consecutive times or re-lighting the 3rd Hyperspace Kicker light.
- Notes:
  - The Center Post is active for a limited amount of time (approximately 60 seconds).
  - The Center Post Light will blink before the Center Post is retracted.
  - When the Center Post Light go out so does the 3rd Hyperspace Chute light, however the preceding Hyperspace Chute Lights remain lit.
  - The 3rd Hyperspace Chute Light may remain lit longer then the Center Post is active if the Hyperspace Kicker is entered While the Center Post is up.
  - The ball can still drain when the Center Post is active so don't be too careless and don't let the Ball rest on the Center Post and one of the Flippers.

## Extra Ball

Overview
- Extra Balls allow a new ball to be played after one has drained without advancing the ball counter, however the table DOES reset.
- Extra Balls may also be awarded using the cheat codes.
  - Refer to the Cheat Codes section for more information.
- An unlimited (no practical limit?) number of Extra Balls may be collected at any one time.
- An unlimited (no practical limit?) number of Extra Balls may be awarded throughout a single game.
- During normal game play there are two ways to obtain Extra Balls.
  - Hyperspace/Out-Lane combination
  - Level 3 Commendation

## Hyperspace/Out-Lane Combination

Overview
- Enter the Hyperspace Kicker 4 consecutive times or re-light the 4th Hyperspace Kicker light.
  - This lights the Out-Lane lights making an Extra Ball "available".
  - This does NOT award an Extra Ball.
- Pass an Out-Lane while the Out-Lane Lights are lit.
  - This DOES award an Extra Ball.
- Notes:
  - The Out-Lane Lights are lit for a limited amount of time (approximately 60 seconds) and blink before they go out.
  - If the Out-Lane lights go out before an Extra Ball is awarded so does the 4th Hyperspace Chute light, however the preceding Hyperspace chute lights remain lit.
  - Only 1 Extra Ball can be awarded for each time the 4th Hyperspace Chute light is lit.
  - If the Hyperspace Kicker is entered while the 4th Hyperspace Chute Light is lit then all the Hyperspace Chute lights go out (Gravity Well activated).

## Level 3 Commendation

Overview
- Knock down all 3 Metal Targets 3 consecutive times.
  - Each time all 3 targets are dropped a commendation is awarded an a Metal Light lit.
  - An Extra Ball is awarded every time a Level 3 Commendation is awarded.
  - Multiple Extra Balls may be awarded by continually achieving Level 3 Commendations.
- Notes:
  - By accepting the following missions all of the dropped Metal Targets are raised, however any Commendation Lights remain lit.
     - Science Mission (Cadet)
     - Bug Hunt Mission (Ensign & Lieutenant)

## Out-Lane Kickers

Overview
- If the ball passes an Out-Lane it will either drain or enter an Out-Lane Kicker.
- If the ball enters an Out-Lane Kicker it is kicked back through the Out-Lane and the kicker is deactivated.
- If the kicker is deactivated the ball will only be able to drain if it passes the Out-Lane.
- The Out-Lane Kickers are reactivated by lighting all 3 corresponding Hazard Lights.

### Left Out-Lane Kicker
- Light all 3 lights associated with the Left Hazard (Radiation) Spot Targets.

### Right Out-Lane Kicker
- Light all 3 lights associated with the Right Hazard (Comet) Spot Targets.

Notes:
- By accepting the following missions some or all of the Hazard Light are extinguished:
  - Bug Hunt Mission (Ensign & Lieutenant) - All target lights are turned off.
  - Stray Comet Mission (Captain & Lt. Commander) - All Right Hazard Lights are turned off.
  - Space Radiation Mission (Captain & Lt. Commander) - All Left Hazard Lights are turned off.

## Replay Ball

Overview
- Replay Balls allow the same ball to be played after it has drained without advancing the ball counter AND without resetting the table.
- Replay Balls are more valuable then Extra Balls but cannot be collected, however they can be awarded an unlimited number of times throughout a single game.
- There are two different kinds of Replay Balls which may both be available at the same time:
  - Automatic Replay
  - Wormhole Replay

### Automatic Replay Ball
- This is awarded any time a ball is discharged by the plunger.
- Availability is indicated by the Automatic Replay Light located at the bottom of the Right Out-Lane below the Right Flipper.
- It is only available for a limited amount of time after the ball enters the Deployment Chute.
  - After approximately 30 seconds the light blinks and goes out.
- If the ball drains while both Replays are available the Wormhole Replay light remains lit.

### Wormhole Replay Ball
- This is awarded when the ball enters an ACTIVE Wormhole and kicks out of the same Wormhole.
  - The Wormhole Light color and the Wormhole Exit Arrow color must match for this to happen.
- Availability is indicated by the Wormhole Replay Light located at the bottom of the Left Out-Lane below the Left Flipper.
- Activate the Wormholes by hitting the Wormhole Spot Target.
- Each Wormhole is identified by a colored light at the top of the Wormhole entrance.
- The Wormhole from which the ball will exit is indicated by the color of the Wormhole Exit Arrow at the entrance to each Wormhole.
  - Change the Wormhole Exit Arrow color by hitting the Wormhole Spot Target or spinning either of the two Flags.
- Notes:
  - If the Secret Mission has been aborted then the Wormholes will have to be re-activated by hitting the Wormhole Target before a Replay Ball can be awarded.

## Re-fuel

Overview
- In order to complete any mission you must have "fuel" throughout the duration of that mission.
- The amount of fuel is indicated by the Fuel Lights in the Fuel Chute.
- The more Fuel Lights are lit the more fuel you have.
  - When all Fuel Lights are lit they will all extinguish in approximately 90 seconds.
- You can partially "Re-Fuel" by sending the ball part way up the Fuel Chute and rolling over any unlit Fuel Lights.
- There are 3 ways to completely "Re-Fuel":
  - Pass the Bonus Lane
  - Rollover the Top (blue) Fuel Light.
  - Hit all 3 Fuel Targets (spot).

### Pass the Bonus Lane
- The easiest way to pass this lane is to send the ball up the Launch Ramp.
- The Bonus Lane is passed when the ball exits the Launch Area.
- This (typically) assures a complete amount of "fuel" whenever a mission is accepted.
  - It is possible for fuel to run out between the time a mission is accepted and the time the ball exits the Launch Area.
  - See "Running Out of Fuel" below.

### Rollover the Top (blue) Fuel Light
- This may be accomplished in 3 ways:
  - Sending the ball all the way up the Fuel Chute.
  - Having the ball drop into the Fuel Chute from the top.
  - Having the ball kick out of the Left Out-Lane Kicker.

### Hit All 3 Fuel Targets
- The Fuel Targets are the 3 Spot Targets spaced around the Remote (Satellite) Bumper.
- Light all 3 lights associated with these targets to "Re-Fuel".
  - By accepting the Bug Hunt (Ensign & Lieutenant) Mission the Fuel Target Lights will be extinguished.

### Running Out of Fuel
- The fuel lights are extinguished in order from top to bottom with the amount of time between each one going out continually increasing.
- Individual Fuel Lights can be re-lit by rolling over them.
- If all the Fuel Lights are extinguished then new missions cannot be accepted and active missions will be "aborted".
- Notes:
  - Each Fuel Light will blink for a short time before it goes out.
  - When only the last Fuel Light remains lit the "Warning - Low Fuel" message will appear in the Instructional Pane of the Score Board.
  - If all the Fuel Lights go out the "Re-fuel Ship" message will appear in the Instructional pane of the Score Board.

## Skipping Ranks

Overview
- "Skipping" a rank is a technique by which the number of Rank Lights is increased without being awarded all 18 progress lights.
- "Skipping" a rank can be accomplished a number of ways with varying degrees of difficulty. From easiest to hardest these are:
  - Mission Based Skipping
  - 4th Mission Drain Skipping
  - Early Mission Acceptance Skipping The 4th Mission Drain & Early Mission Acceptance techniques may be bugs.

### Mission Based Skipping
- This technique is based on the Time Warp Mission only.
- Complete the Time Warp Mission by passing the Launch Ramp.
  - Awards 9 Progress Lights and 1 Rank Light.
  - Completing this mission when 9 or more Progress Lights are already lit will award 2 Rank Lights.
- Notes:
  - This technique can only be used when the current rank is Commander, Commodore, or Admiral (6, 7, or 8 rank lights).
  - Refer to the 'Missions' section for more information.

### 4th Mission Drain Skipping
- Complete the 4th (all Mission Targets) mission to increase in rank.
- Allow the ball to drain before the Progress Lights stop blinking in celebration.
  - This keeps all 18 progress lights lit.
  - Only one more mission (any mission) need be completed to increase in rank.
- Notes:
  - This technique is most effective during the Cadet, Captain, and Lt. Commander ranks (1, 4 or 5 rank lights).
  - This technique can be used repeatedly to increase the rank each time a mission is completed.
  - A new Ball will be deployed and the board reset when the Ball is drained so have an Extra Ball available.
  - This technique does not work when the Replay Light is lit.

### Early Mission Acceptance Skipping
- Complete any mission.
- Select and accept a new mission before the Progress Lights stop blinking in celebration.
  - This keeps all 18 progress lights lit.
  - Only the newly selected mission needs to be completed to increase in rank.
- Notes:
  - This technique can be used repeatedly to increase the rank each time a mission is completed.
  - This technique is extremely difficult to use.
  - It is impossible to use this technique on the following missions because the ball is held in/on the table element used to complete the mission.
    - Launch Training
    - Rescue Mission
    - Stray Comet Mission
    - Maelstrom Mission

## Upgrade Bumpers

Overview
- Upgrading the bumpers makes the bumper worth more points when it is hit.
- The bumpers can be upgraded 3 times each allowing for 4 different upgrade levels
  - Level 1: Blue   (Default)
  - Level 2: Green  (1st Upgrade)
  - Level 3: Yellow (2nd Upgrade)
  - Level 4: Red    (3rd Upgrade)
- Once upgraded the bumpers remain at each level for approximately 60 seconds. After that time the bumpers are downgraded 1 level.
  - Bumpers can only be upgraded 1 level at a time.
  - In order to increase to level 3 the bumpers must be upgraded while they are set a level 2.
  - In order to increase to level 4 the bumpers must be upgraded while they are set a level 3.
  - Upgrading the bumpers while they are set at level 4 resets the time before they are downgraded.
- There are two sets(types) of bumpers: Attack Bumpers & Engine Bumpers
  - For more information refer to 'Bumpers' in the 'Table Elements' section.

### Attack Bumpers
- The Attack Bumpers are upgraded by lighting all 3 Re-entry Lane Lights.
- If 1 or 2 of the Re-entry Lane Lights are lit they can be rotated by activating the Flippers.
  - Each Flipper rotates the lights in a different direction.
- Refer to 'Bumpers' in the 'Table Elements' section for information on point values at each level.

### Engine Bumpers
- The Engine Bumpers are upgraded by lighting all 3 Engine Lane Lights.
- If 1 or 2 of the Engine Lane Lights are lit they can be rotated by activating the Flippers.
  - Each Flipper rotates the lights in a different direction.
- Refer to 'Bumpers' in the 'Table Elements' section for information on point values at each level.

- BUG: If the number of players is changed before the game starts the change will not register.
  - This only occurs if no game has previously been completed during the current session.

Up to 4 players are able to play at once.

The current player (1, 2, 3 or 4) is indicated in the Player Window as well
  as being shown in the Information Window whenever the ball drains.
- The current player remains active until all Replay Balls and Extra Balls are lost.
- This is the only way to advance the Player Counter.
- Each players score increase separately from the other players.

The "Max" cheat codes work only for the current player.
- If the "bmax" cheat code is entered the table must be 'Tilted' to advance the Player Counter.

The "hidden_test" cheat code works for all players.

To re-enter single player mode change the number of players to 1 using the
  pull down menu.


# XIII. Cheat Codes

The cheat codes can be used to play different levels, practice or examine
  specific table functions.

Type cheat codes during game play. No points are awarded for entering cheat
  codes.

Scores achieved while using the "Max Codes" cannot be added to the 'High
  Scores List'.

Scores achieved using the Test Codes can not be added to the 'High Scores
  List'.
- Scores achieved using the "hidden test" code which are high enough to can be added to the 'High Scores List' will cause the "High Score" message to be displayed, however these scores are not added to the 'High Score List'.

## Max Codes

"1max"
- Awards an Extra Ball.
- Type this code multiple times to get more Extra Balls.
- The number pad may not be used to enter this code.

"bmax"
- Awards Unlimited Balls.
- If the Ball drains a new Ball will be kicked from the Yellow Wormhole automatically.
- To cancel this code 'Tilt' the table.
- No other cheats may be entered when this code is active.

"gmax"
- Activates the Gravity Well.

"rmax"
- Increases the number of Rank Lights by 1.
- Type this code multiple times to further increase rank.

## Test Codes

"hidden_test"
- Enters 'Test Mode'
- Allows the Ball to be moved with the mouse by clicking & holding in the game window.
- Once this code is entered it is active for the entire session.
  - The game must be closed and restarted to dismiss this code.
- Use the following keys after the 'hidden_test' code has been entered:
  - "h" – Changes the 2nd place score to 1,000,000,000 and allows the Player name to be entered. Does not change 1st place, even if it's less that 1 Billion points.
  - "m" – Displays the system memory in a separate window.
  - "r" – Increases the number of Rank Lights by 1.
  - "y" – Displays the game frame-rate in the title bar.
- The "Max" codes do not work while 'test mode' is active.


# XIV. Advice & Strategy

This section is intended to aid new and advanced players in increasing both
their score and enjoyment of the game. Strategy and advice is subjective. If
you don't agree or have an alternate strategy which works for you then, by all
means, ignore this section.

## General Advice

Be flexible.
- Know what you want to do and set floating priorities.
- Update and revise your priorities as the table changes.

Always try to have a Replay available.

Play mainly to complete missions.

Enter the Hyperspace Kicker as much as possible, except when it will result
  in Gravity Well.

Be wary of the Gravity Well, it can make the Ball do funny things, plus it
  resets the Hyperspace Lights.
- If it becomes active try and 'Normalize' gravity as quickly as possible.
- It is advantageous to "activate" & "normalize" the Gravity Well when Field Multipliers are activated due to the large number of points awarded.

Don't get hung up on the Medal Targets.
- Fixating on them keeps you from scoring points elsewhere.
- Only try to hit them when the 2nd (orange) or 3rd (purple) Medal Lights are already lit.

Have a minimum point total and/or rank/progress you want to achieve for your
  first Ball.
- If the Ball counter ticks to 2 before you're there, start a new game.

Take advantage of the Field Multipliers when you get them (10x runs up the
  score REALLY fast!).
- Field Multipliers don't apply to Bonuses, Awards & Jackpots.

The game moves different speeds depending on how many applications you have
  running.
- Experiment running different applications in the background and take note of when you play better.

Even when the Center Post is up the Ball can still drain so be careful.
- Don't let the Ball rest on the Center Post and one of the Flippers.

## Specific Advice

If you have one of the upper level multipliers (3x, 5x or 10x) it's worth it
  to get the Gravity Well, it can be worth up to 1.5 million points.

The Yellow Wormhole is easiest to hit, followed by the Red. Try to use these
  two to receive Replays.
- These 2 Wormholes can be hit directly from either flipper.

The far left Medal Target is hardest to hit.
- If it's already down and at least one Medal Light is lit try aiming for the remaining targets to get an Extra Ball.
- When deliberately aiming for the Medal Targets try and hit this one first.

If 2 or more Medal Lights are lit concentrate at hitting the Medal Targets.

When the Ball is kicked out of the Black Hole Kicker it will hit the middle
  Medal Target.
- If this target is up the Ball will rebound into the right Out-Lane about 50% of the time. Try and nudge the table to keep this from happening.
- If this target is down the Ball will hit the right Medal Target and normally rebound to the upper part of the table.
- If both the middle & right Medal Targets are down the Ball will bounce and hit the bottom Booster Target then rebound to the Left Flipper.
  - If the bottom Booster Target is down the Ball will bounce between the flippers and drain if the Center Post is not up. Try and nudge the table to keep this from happening.

When the Ball is kicked out of the Hyperspace Kicker it will bounce off the
  Left Flipper & rebound up the Launch Ramp about 70% of the time if the
  flipper is NOT activated.
- If the wormholes are activated the Wormhole Exit Light will normally rotate 2 colors upon the Ball being kicked out of the Hyperspace Kicker.
- Use this to catch the Ball on the Left Flipper and shoot it into the Yellow Wormhole to get a Replay Ball.

There are a couple of tricks so only one mission needs to be completed to
  upgrade the Rank Lights.
- See the "Skipping Ranks" part of the "Secondary Objectives" section for more information.

## Things to Get Good At

### Catching the Ball on the Flippers.
- Do this by holding the flipper keys so the Ball comes to rest on the Flippers before shooting the Ball up the table.
  - Refer to 'Catching' in the 'Concepts section for more information.
- This allows you to shoot the ball more accurately.

### Sending the Ball up the Launch Ramp.
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the middle of the Right Flipper.
- This allows you to accept missions, Re-fuel, move the Ball from the Right Flipper to the Left Flipper.

### Sending the Ball up the Hyperspace Chute.
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the end of the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive the Jackpot, the Center Post, chances at an Extra Ball and the Gravity Well.

### Sending the Ball up the Fuel Chute.
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the end of the Right Flipper.
- This allows you to Re-fuel, get the Ball to the Green Wormhole, and get the Ball to the Re-Entry Lanes.

### Sending the Ball into the Yellow Wormhole.
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the tip of the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to get a Replay Ball when the Wormhole Exit Light is Yellow.

### Launch Ramp Skill Shots.
- Do this by catching the Ball with the Left Flipper as it drops through the Bonus Lane, but not allowing it to come to rest. When it bounces out over the left Flipper shoot it back up the Launch Ramp.
- This allows you to complete missions and receive Skill Shot Awards.

### Hyperspace Skill Shots.
- Do this by "one timing" the Ball back up the chute with the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive the Jackpot, the Center Post, chances at an Extra Ball and the Gravity Well.

### Hitting the left Medal Target.
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the middle of the Right Flipper or using the Launch Ramp Skill Shot technique from the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive Commendations & Extra Balls.


# XV. Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) & Comments

## Why did you write this guide?
- Refer the the 'Guide Purpose' part of the 'The Guide' section.

## Where can I find this game?
- The original version of the game was developed by Cinematronics and published by Maxis in 1995 as part of "Full Tilt! Pinball".
- The original Windows version came with 'Windows 95 Plus!' add-on.
- My version of the game shipped with Windows XP.
- You can also find it on the internet if you put in a little time.
  - Do a search for "3D Pinball Space Cadet Download"
  - Be weary. I've seen a version out there which is exactly the same but all the messages are in German!

## What's your high score?
- 62,689,750 (that's over 62.6 million) with no cheating.
- My low high score (5th highest) is just over 46 million.

## Only 62 Million?
- I actually may have been able to get more points, but I was playing under the (incorrect) impression that if you got 18 progress lights with a rank of Fleet Admiral that the game would freeze and you wouldn't be able to post your high score.

## This game is so basic. Why is this guide so long?
- As simple as the game may seem there's a lot of complexity hiding under the surface.
- If you want to be really proficient at pinball there's more to it then hitting the flippers and watching the ball bounce around.

## Where'd you get all this information? How did you compile this guide?
- I began by playing (a lot) and noting my observations.
- I used the cheat codes (especially "hidden_test") to test what happened in different scenarios, note how many points different elements were worth and validate other observations.

## What happens if the score board 'rolls over' (score reaches 1 billion)?
- It resets to 0 and then continues to accumulate points as normal.
- The game cannot accept high scores over 1 Billion points.

## How do the Jackpots/Bonuses work?
- It's complicated.
- See the Bonus', Jackpots & Awards Section.

## Does the game freezes if you advance beyond the Rank of Fleet Admiral?
- I've seen this noted on certain websites & walkthroughs and found it to be untrue.
- It may have been an earlier bug the fixed with the XP version.
- If you're worried about the possibility use the cheat codes and check for yourself. (That's what I did.)

## Did I skip a rank? How did that happen?
- You may have.
- Check the 'Skipping Ranks' part of the 'Secondary Objectives' section for various rank "skipping" techniques.

## I changed the number of players but it didn't seem to work. What's the deal?
- This appears to be a bug in the game.
- In order to change the number of players you must do one of the following things:
  - Change the number of players then Exit and restart the game.
  - Begin a game and then change the number of players. This will cancel the current game. Any high scores achieved during the canceled game will not be saved.

## The Ball went through my flipper! Aaaargh!!!
- This has happed to me a few times.
- I don't know what causes it and, yes, it is very annoying.

## The cheat code you gave me doesn't work.
- They all work on my version.
- I don't know why it doesn't work on yours.

## I think your advice/strategy is stupid.
- Fine. Don't use it.
- It's how I achieved my high scores, but if your score is higher than 62.7 million you must have a better strategy so use that instead.

## Do you have a drawing showing all the table elements?  Can I get a copy?
- I do have a drawing, but you can't contact me so unless it's in the same place you found this guide you probably can't get a copy.
- If you check the game Help there's a decent drawing with the elements labeled, but be wary of the associated advice, it's not all accurate.

## I found an error or omission, can I contact you?
- No.
- As I find these I'll update them, but just about everything's already in here.

## But I really want to contact you.
- No.
- Go away.
- Stop bothering me.
  - If you're really desperate and somewhat resourceful you should be able to find a way to contact me (I'm talking about you, Sebastian), but I'm not going to tell you how.

## But I have a question.
- Everything I know is in this guide.
- I've put in a lot of time and made it as accurate as possible.
- If you have a question that's not answered here I don't know the answer.

## When will you update this guide again?
- There's no telling. Be happy you've received any updates at all.
- As I think of or discover new information which should be added I'll update, but it's already pretty complete.
- The 'Version History' section below can give you an idea about the randomness of the updates.
- New revisions will most likely be more like "refinements" from this point forward, anyway.
