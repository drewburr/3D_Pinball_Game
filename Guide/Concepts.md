The following sections present basic pinball ideas as they relate to 3D Space
Cadet Pinball. They are intended to aid younger players who may have never
before heard of or seen pinball previously. For more information the Wikipedia
reference to pinball is very informative.

## Pinball Basics

Pinball is a type of coin-operated arcade game where a player attempts to score points by manipulating one or more metal balls on a playfield or table inside a glass covered case called a pinball machine. The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. The Secondary objective is to maximize the time spent playing. Some games, including 3D Space Cadet Pinball, have rudimentary storylines to play through offering the player additional objectives and sense of accomplishment. The player begins with a limited number of balls (typically 3) to accomplish these goals.

Pinball on the computer is based on the physical pinball machine. Pinball machines were introduced in the early 1930s and became a dominant form of entertainment for youth after World War II through the late 1970s. They were eventually overtaken by electronic video games as the game of choice in arcades.

All modern pinball machines consist of a table, plunger, flippers and various other table elements used to score points. The table itself is where the rest of the elements reside. It is sloped slightly from back to front allowing the ball to move by gravity toward the player and the bottom of the table. The ball is initially propelled onto the table via the plunger.

The plunger is a spring-loaded rod with a small handle which is pulled back and let go to allow the ball to be struck and sent onto the table. The player can control the amount of force used for launching by pulling the plunger varying distances, thus changing the compression of the spring. This is often used for a "skill shot", in which a player attempts to launch a ball so that it exactly hits a specified target. Once the ball is in motion on the table the plunger is not used again until the ball drains (see below) and another ball must be brought onto the table.

Once on the table the ball interacts with the table elements primarily by striking them. For each element struck points are added to the score. Pinball scoring can be peculiar and varies greatly from machine to machine. For more particulars on how points are scored for 3D Space Cadet Pinball refer to the Table and Bonus’, Jackpots & Awards sections.

The player’s primary means of controlling the ball once it’s been put into play on the table is via the flippers. Traditionally there are 2 flippers (left & right) located at the bottom of the table. The player activates the flippers in order to send the ball back up the table into the scoring elements and away from the Drain Area.

For more information on table elements refer to the 'Table' section.

## Catching

Catching is a term used to describe the act of allowing the ball to come to rest on one of the flippers. It is a higher level technique used to gain added control over the ball and allow the player to more accurately send the ball up the table at a desired target.

Typically the player catches the ball by holding the flipper in the activated position a having the ball fall on to it. This allows the ball to bounce between the flipper and the return lane eventually coming to rest at the base of the flipper. The player then releases the flipper, allows the ball to roll down the flipper to the desired distance then activates the flipper again.

The ball can also be caught as it drops to the flipper through the return lane.

## Drain

The ball drains when it falls below the flippers and off the bottom of the table. The ball can drain by either dropping between the flippers or passing one of the Out-Lanes. 3D Space Cadet Pinball has Out-Lane Kickers which can save the ball from being drained and send it back up the table.

For more information on the Out-Lane Kickers refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Table Reset

Table reset occurs after the ball drains. It returns all the targets and lights to their default settings.

In 3D Space Cadet Pinball the lights indicating the player’s progress through the story (Rank & Progress Lights) are not reset with the rest of the table.

## Extra Balls

Typically the player begins with 3 balls available and after these balls drain the current game is over. Extra balls, sometimes known as Free Balls, are balls which allow the player to continue play without advancing the ball counter. Extra Balls can typically be collected in great numbers.

If a ball drains and an extra ball has been awarded then the table resets (see above) and a new ball is placed at the plunger. This new ball, however, does not count towards the 3 balls with which the player begins. Once the last awarded extra ball drains the ball counter advances as normal.

Extra Balls can be equated to an extra life in most video games.

For more information on Extra Balls refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Replay Balls

Replay balls are similar to extra balls with one major difference: if the current ball drains and a replay ball has previously been awarded (is available) then the table DOES NOT reset. The new ball placed in the plunger is, for all intent and purposes, the same ball which just drained and the player is allowed to continue the game as if the ball never drained in the first place.

Just as with Extra Balls the ball counter does not advance after the ball drains if a replay is available, however, only one replay ball may typically be collected at any one time.

Replay Balls can be equated to temporary invincibility in most video games.

For more information on Replay Balls refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' section.

## Nudge/Tilt

Nudging is the secondary way in which the player controls the ball. On physical pinball machines, if the player wished to affect the balls movement when it was not within range of the flippers they would physically jostle the machine. This would affect the angel of the table and cause the ball to roll in a different direction. Nudging the table could be considered a form of cheating and is, therefore, limited by the tilt function.

If the table were nudged or tilted too far or for too long then the table will realize that the player is trying to gain an unfair advantage. This results in the table entering "tilt" mode. All player inputs and all table functions are ceased causing the current ball to drain. The table then resets (see above) and play continues as normal.

For more information refer to "TILT!" in the 'Informational' part of the 'Messages' section.

## End of Game

The game ends when all of the balls the player began with (typically 3) have drained.

The ball counter on the score board indicates the current ball count. This count does not include extra balls or replay balls.

## High Scores

If the game ends and the player has achieved a high enough score then that score and the players name can be added to the High Score Table. This is a list of all the high scores which have been achieved on a particular machine. It allows players to brag to their friends and display their skill to others who play on the same machine.

For more information refer to "High Scores" Dialog Box in the 'Program Controls & Menus' section.
