# XIV. Advice & Strategy

This section is intended to aid new and advanced players in increasing both
their score and enjoyment of the game. Strategy and advice is subjective. If
you don't agree or have an alternate strategy which works for you then, by all
means, ignore this section.

## General Advice

Be flexible.
- Know what you want to do and set floating priorities.
- Update and revise your priorities as the table changes.

Always try to have a Replay available.

Play mainly to complete missions.

Enter the Hyperspace Kicker as much as possible, except when it will result in Gravity Well.

Be wary of the Gravity Well, it can make the Ball do funny things, plus it resets the Hyperspace Lights.
- If it becomes active try and 'Normalize' gravity as quickly as possible.
- It is advantageous to "activate" & "normalize" the Gravity Well when Field Multipliers are activated due to the large number of points awarded.

Don't get hung up on the Medal Targets.
- Fixating on them keeps you from scoring points elsewhere.
- Only try to hit them when the 2nd (orange) or 3rd (purple) Medal Lights are already lit.

Have a minimum point total and/or rank/progress you want to achieve for your first Ball.
- If the Ball counter ticks to 2 before you're there, start a new game.

Take advantage of the Field Multipliers when you get them (10x runs up the score REALLY fast!).
- Field Multipliers don't apply to Bonuses, Awards & Jackpots.

The game moves different speeds depending on how many applications you have running.
- Experiment running different applications in the background and take note of when you play better.

Even when the Center Post is up the Ball can still drain so be careful.
- Don't let the Ball rest on the Center Post and one of the Flippers.

## Specific Advice

If you have one of the upper level multipliers (3x, 5x or 10x) it's worth it to get the Gravity Well, it can be worth up to 1.5 million points.

The Yellow Wormhole is easiest to hit, followed by the Red. Try to use these two to receive Replays.
- These 2 Wormholes can be hit directly from either flipper.

The far left Medal Target is hardest to hit.
- If it's already down and at least one Medal Light is lit try aiming for the remaining targets to get an Extra Ball.
- When deliberately aiming for the Medal Targets try and hit this one first.

If 2 or more Medal Lights are lit concentrate at hitting the Medal Targets.

When the Ball is kicked out of the Black Hole Kicker it will hit the middle Medal Target.
- If this target is up the Ball will rebound into the right Out-Lane about 50% of the time. Try and nudge the table to keep this from happening.
- If this target is down the Ball will hit the right Medal Target and normally rebound to the upper part of the table.
- If both the middle & right Medal Targets are down the Ball will bounce and hit the bottom Booster Target then rebound to the Left Flipper.
  - If the bottom Booster Target is down the Ball will bounce between the flippers and drain if the Center Post is not up. Try and nudge the table to keep this from happening.

When the Ball is kicked out of the Hyperspace Kicker it will bounce off the Left Flipper & rebound up the Launch Ramp about 70% of the time if the flipper is NOT activated.
- If the wormholes are activated the Wormhole Exit Light will normally rotate 2 colors upon the Ball being kicked out of the Hyperspace Kicker.
- Use this to catch the Ball on the Left Flipper and shoot it into the Yellow Wormhole to get a Replay Ball.

There are a couple of tricks so only one mission needs to be completed to upgrade the Rank Lights.
- See the "Skipping Ranks" part of the "Secondary Objectives" section for more information.

## Things to Get Good At

### Catching the Ball on the Flippers
- Do this by holding the flipper keys so the Ball comes to rest on the Flippers before shooting the Ball up the table.
  - Refer to 'Catching' in the 'Concepts section for more information.
- This allows you to shoot the ball more accurately.

### Sending the Ball up the Launch Ramp
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the middle of the Right Flipper.
- This allows you to accept missions, Re-fuel, move the Ball from the Right Flipper to the Left Flipper.

### Sending the Ball up the Hyperspace Chute
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the end of the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive the Jackpot, the Center Post, chances at an Extra Ball and the Gravity Well.

### Sending the Ball up the Fuel Chute
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the end of the Right Flipper.
- This allows you to Re-fuel, get the Ball to the Green Wormhole, and get the Ball to the Re-Entry Lanes.

### Sending the Ball into the Yellow Wormhole
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the tip of the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to get a Replay Ball when the Wormhole Exit Light is Yellow.

### Launch Ramp Skill Shots
- Do this by catching the Ball with the Left Flipper as it drops through the Bonus Lane, but not allowing it to come to rest. When it bounces out over the left Flipper shoot it back up the Launch Ramp.
- This allows you to complete missions and receive Skill Shot Awards.

### Hyperspace Skill Shots
- Do this by "one timing" the Ball back up the chute with the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive the Jackpot, the Center Post, chances at an Extra Ball and the Gravity Well.

### Hitting the left Medal Target
- Do this by shooting the Ball from the middle of the Right Flipper or using the Launch Ramp Skill Shot technique from the Left Flipper.
- This allows you to receive Commendations & Extra Balls.
