# XII. Multi-Player Mode

Set the number of players by selecting 'Options' and 'Select Players from the pull-down menus
- Switching the number of players automatically restarts the current game.
- BUG: If the number of players is changed before the game starts the change will not register.
  - This only occurs if no game has previously been completed during the current session.

Up to 4 players are able to play at once.

The current player (1, 2, 3 or 4) is indicated in the Player Window as well as being shown in the Information Window whenever the ball drains.
- The current player remains active until all Replay Balls and Extra Balls are lost.
- This is the only way to advance the Player Counter.
- Each players score increase separately from the other players.

The "Max" cheat codes work only for the current player.
- If the "bmax" cheat code is entered the table must be 'Tilted' to advance the Player Counter.

The "hidden_test" cheat code works for all players.

To re-enter single player mode change the number of players to 1 using the pull down menu.
