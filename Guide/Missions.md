# Missions

- Missions are the primary way to progress through the game.

- Missions give the player a set of goals and sense of accomplishment beyond simply accumulating points.

- It is not required that any missions be completed, but they are the fastest way to accumulate points.
  - For more information on game strategy refer to the 'Secondary Objectives' and 'Advice and Strategy' sections.

## Mission Basics

Use the Mission Targets to select a mission.
- Each target corresponds to a different mission based on current rank.
- The last target hit selects the mission.
- If all the targets are hit (No Mission Target Lights lit) then the 4th mission (All) is selected.

To accept a mission pass the Launch Ramp once the mission is selected.

Look at the Score Board messages to help you know what to do and how you're progressing through the mission.

Look for the blinking Mission Arrows to help you know where to aim your Ball.

A mission will terminate if all the Fuel Lights go out.
  - Watch the Fuel Lights and the Score Board for the "Warning - Low Fuel" message.
- Send the Ball up the Fuel Chute, through the Bonus Lane, into the Left Out-Lane Kicker, or hit all 3 Fuel Targets to Re-fuel.
  - Refer to the Secondary Objectives section for more information.

If the Ball drains while in the middle of a mission the mission is aborted.
- The mission remains active if a Replay Ball is available.

Difficulty levels listed are subjective and relative within each rank.

Accumulate 18 Progress lights to increase in rank.

Ranks are as follows:

| Rank Lights   | Rank
|-------------- |----------
| 1 Rank Light  | Cadet

| 4 Rank Lights | Captain
| 5 Rank Lights | Lt. Commander

## Final Mission Note

Some strategy guides/walkthroughs indicate that if you light all 18 Progress Light with a Rank of Fleet Admiral that the game will freeze and you will not be able to post your high score. THIS IS NOT TRUE on my version so you may want to test it using the Cheat Codes before you're in a position where you have to choose to complete the Fleet Admiral rank and lock up the game.
